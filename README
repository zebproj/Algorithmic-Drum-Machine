Algorithmic Drum Machine

The algorithmic drummachine as seen on my blog blobofbluegoo.blogspot.com

The python file will generate a score file called drumscore.sco, which is meant to be then read by the CSD file. When the CSD file is run, it will generate the drum sounds based on the instructions in the score file.

NOTE: Drum samples are not included, as they take up a lot of space and are not free samples. Sorry about that.
There are plenty of good drum samples available online that will sound just dandy with this code. You just have to change the filenames in the <CsInstruments> Section of the CSD file, and that's it!

If you'd like to contact me about this email me at ralphbluecoat at gmail dot com.

Thanks for reading!
